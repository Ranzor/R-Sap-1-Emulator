I hardcode the functionality of the microcodes in each clock step of an instruction.\n\nBoth for a more accurate simulation AND much cleaner code.. Refactor so that you actualy use microcodes. Make each microcode (I.e AO = Output A Register to Bus) work like it should and then just call the required microcodes at the correct steps.\n\nThis is more accurate to hardware."
